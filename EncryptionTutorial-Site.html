		<h1>The Caesar Cipher</h1>
		<p>
&emsp; The Caesar Cipher (CC) is a very old cipher. Although it is rather impractical for actual security, the Caesar Cipher (CC) is a very simple introduction to encryption and decryption. 
The encryption is simply to shift the letters of the alphabet to the right.
<br> <br>
In practice: 
<br> <br>
Message: "This is super secret" 
<br> <br>
When encrypted with a shift of one (1) becomes 
<br> <br>
Encrypted Message: "uijt jt tvqfs tfdsfu" 
<p>
&emsp; With a shift of one (1) each letter is shifted to the right once, A->B, B->C, C->D, ... Y->Z, Z->A, etc. 
This method of encrypting a message makes it very easy to decrypt, simply shift back whatever number you used as the shift to encrypt the message.
        </p>
<p>
&emsp; For a more in-depth explanation of the CC, as well as seeing an encrypter/decrypter program in action, you can visit http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/
        </p>        
<p>&emsp; While you can use whatever shift you desire, even past 26(alphabet size, though this is the same as using a smaller number, I.E 27 shifts is the same as 2 shifts). </p>

&emsp;The shift of 13 is the most common, this shift is known as ROT13. However, our code will be able to use whatever shift number(key) the user desires to input.

<h2>The Caesar Cipher One Letter at a Time</h2>
        
&emsp;The simplest method of encoding a letter is to add the key to the letter itself. (+ "A" 1) However, we cannot add letters to numbers, so we must convert "A" to a number(int)
We can use <code class="inline">(string->int "A")</code> to do this, the result is 65.
(This is due to the ASCII table, which is the number referenced to a character, http://www.asciitable.com/)

So, with a key of 1, A becomes (+  65 1) = 66. If we use (int->string 66) we get "B".
now we can decode this letter, doing the opposite
B to a number is 66, subtract the key, 65, 65 to a letter is "A".

Now we can do this in code.

Code: 
<code> 
<font color="blue"> 
(check-expect (encode-one-letter "A")   65)
(check-expect (encode-one-letter "F")   70)
(check-expect (encode-one-letter "Z")   90)

(define (encode-one-letter letter) 
  (string->int letter))

(check-expect (encrypt-one-letter "A" 1) "B")
(check-expect (encrypt-one-letter "F" 1) "G")
(check-expect (encrypt-one-letter "Z" 1) "A") 
; This test will fail as "A" is expected, but it returned "["

(define (encrypt-one-letter letter key)
  (int->string (+ (string->int letter) key)))
</font>
</code>
&emsp;&emsp;The above code works, however, if we try to change "Z", it does not go to "A" like we want. This is because of the ascii table. Z is 90 on the ASCII table, and [ is 91.
So, we have to account for the loop around of the alphabet. We can do this using modulo, which returns the remainder of 2 numbers. (modulo 5 3) = 2
Note that (modulo (0-25) 26) will return the number given (0-25) (modulo 20 26) = 20, etc. However (modulo 26 26) = 0; Which brings us back to "A".
<code>
<font color="blue"> 
(check-expect (encrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "A" 1) "B")
(check-expect (encrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "F" 1) "G")
(check-expect (encrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "Z" 1) "A") ; No error thrown!

(define (encrypt-one-letter-with-modulo letter key)
  (int->string (+ 
    (string->int "A") 
    (modulo (- (+ (string->int letter) key) (string->int "A")) 26))))
</font>
</code>
&emsp;Note: we can simply replace (string->int "A") with 65, as we know the value, this saves the computer minimal processor power, but it mostly just clears up the code a bit.
This is a matter of personal preference, if you prefer having the calculation to show where 65 came from feel free, you can also just add a comment to explain the 65.
Ex:
<code>
<font color="blue"> 
; Origin of 65 in the following function: (string->int "A") = 65

(define (encode-one-letter-with-modulo letter key)
  (int->string (+ 65 (modulo (- (+ (string->int letter) key) 65) 26))))
</font>                      
</code>
&emsp;We now have a one letter encrypting function, what we need to be able to do is decrypt the resulting encrypted character. So now we will create a one letter decrypting function.
<p>
This is actually a very simple function to write. 
Feel free to attempt it on your own before reading on.
        </p>
Hint: All you need to do is the opposite of the encrypt function.
<code>
<font color="blue">
(check-expect (decode-one-letter "A")   65)
(check-expect (decode-one-letter "F")   70)
(check-expect (decode-one-letter "Z")   90)

; NOTE: this is THE SAME FUNCTION as the encode function. 
(define (decode-one-letter letter) 
  (string->int letter))

(check-expect (decrypt-one-letter "B" 1) "A")
(check-expect (decrypt-one-letter "F" 1) "E")
;(check-expect (decrypt-one-letter "A" 1) "Z")  
; Throws an error, "Z" is expected, returned "@"

(define (decrypt-one-letter letter key)
  (int->string (- (string->int letter) key)))

(check-expect (decrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "B" 1) "A")
(check-expect (decrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "G" 1) "F")
(check-expect (decrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "A" 1) "Z") 
;No error thrown!

(define (decrypt-one-letter-with-modulo letter key)
  (int->string (+ 
    (string->int "A") 
    (modulo (- (- (string->int letter) key) (string->int "A")) 26))))
</font>
</code>
Now we can encrypt and decrypt a single character. 
<code>
<font color="blue">
(encrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "A" 1) ; Outputs "B"
(decrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "B" 1) ; Outputs "A"
</font>
</code>
        <h2>Anonymous Functions</h2>
A standard function
<code>
<font color="blue">
(define (times-five x)
  (* x 5))

; Calling the function
(times-five 4)
; OUTPUTS -> 20

; A standard function used in another function

(map times-five
     (list 1 2 3))

; OUTPUTS -> (list 5 10 15)

; An Anonymous function used in a lambda

(map (lambda(x)
       (* x 5))
     (list 1 2 3))
            
; OUTPUTS -> (list 5 10 15)
</font>
</code>
&emsp;Note:
That (* x 5) is not defined anywhere.
This anonymous function (* x 5) is not declared or used anywhere else.
This allows for quick, one-time functions, to be created and used without cluttering up your code.
It can also speed up your program significantly on large-scale programs (compared to defining a function each time).
Note that anonymous functions are created at run-time.

        <h2> What is Currying?</h2>
      
&emsp;“… currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument. 
For example, a function that takes two arguments, one from X and one from Y, and produces outputs in Z, by currying is translated into a function that takes a single argument from X and produces as outputs functions from Y to Z.”  -Wikipedia

This can be difficult to understand so let’s look at an example.
<code>
<font color="blue">
(define times
  (lambda (y)
    (* 4 y)))

(times 5) ; OUTPUTS: 20

; In the above example, we see a simple curried example of (* 4 y) -> output.
; In this case, 5 becomes y.

(define add
  (lambda (x)
   (lambda (y)
     (+ x y))))

(add 5) ; OUTPUTS: (lambda (a1) …)

(define addit (add 5))

(addit 4) ; OUTPUTS: 9

; In this above example, we see a more complex nested curried function. This 
; allows us to enter two variables into the function. (+ x y) -> output.
; In this case, x is 5 and y is 4, although it does not matter as this is addition.
</font>
</code>
        
        <h2>The Caesar Cipher with a full message using Currying</h2>
&emsp;Of course, we would like to be able to encrypt and decrypt a message without calling a function for every single character in the message. 
This is where we can use what we have learned from the single character encrypter and decrypter. By placing components of them into a new function(s) we can create a function(s) that can encrypt or decrypt a string. 
<code>
<font color="blue">
(check-expect ((create-encode-character-function 1) "A") "B") 

(define (create-encode-character-function key)
  (lambda(letter) (int->string (+ 
    (string->int "A") 
    (modulo (- (+ (string->int letter) key) (string->int "A")) 26)))))

(define (encrypt-message message key)
  (implode (map (create-encode-character-function key) (explode message))))

(encrypt-message "HELLO" 1)

(define (decode-character-function key)
  (lambda(letter) (int->string (+ 
    (string->int "A") 
    (modulo (+ (- (string->int letter) key) (string->int "A")) 26)))))
 
(define (decrypt-message message key)
  (implode (map (decode-character-function key) (explode message))))

(decrypt-message "IFMMP" 1) 
</font>
</code>
&emsp;We now have a fully working encryption/decryption function.
Note that spaces will not work properly, nor punctuation marks. These functions are made only for alphabetical characters.
<code>
<font color="blue">
(encrypt-message "HOWAREYOU" 5) ;OUTPUTS: "MTBFWJDTZ"
(decrypt-message "MTBFWJDTZ" 5) ;OUTPUTS: "HOWAREYOU"

(encrypt-message "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" 1) 
;OUTPUTS:        "BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZA"
    
(decrypt-message "BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZA" 1)
;OUTPUTS:        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
</font>
</code>
      
        <h1>A Modern Cipher: Streaming Cipher</h1>

&emsp;Now we can create a new version of these functions that use a random key. This means the code is much more difficult to decrypt unless you have the correct seed and random number.
A seed is the number placed into a slew of functions that "randomize" the value. In this case, the key is the seed and the random number is (random 26). Both of these numbers can be changed. Thus making it a stronger encryption.
Because a computer can't actually randomize a number, we can get the same number repeatedly by calling random when the key is the same. 
<code>
<font color="blue">
(random 26) ;outputs 0
(random 26) ;outputs 3
</font>
</code>
If you run this again, they will output the same values.
<code>
<font color="blue">
(define key 10)

(random-seed key)

(define (lock) (random 26))

lock ; This gives the value (key) to shift the messages characters by. 

(check-expect (encode-char "B") "C")
(check-expect (encode-char "L") "E")

(check-expect (decode-char "C") "J")
(check-expect (decode-char "B") "O")

(define (encode-char char)
  (int->string (+ 
    (string->int "A") 
    (modulo (- (+ (string->int char) (lock)) (string->int "A")) 26))))

(define (decode-char char)
  (int->string (+ 
    (string->int "A") 
    (modulo (- (- (string->int char) (lock)) (string->int "A")) 26))))

(check-expect ((encode-char-function) "A") "U")
(check-expect ((encode-char-function) "B") "U")

(check-expect ((decode-char-function) "D") "G")
(check-expect ((decode-char-function) "Z") "T")
(check-expect ((decode-char-function) "D") "J") 

(define (encode-char-function)
  (lambda(letter) (int->string (+
    (string->int "A") 
    (modulo (- (+ (string->int letter) (lock)) (string->int "A")) 26)))))

(define (encrypt-message-rand message)
  (implode (map (encode-char-function) (explode message))))

(encrypt-message-rand "HELLO")

(define (decode-char-function)
  (lambda(letter) (int->string (+ 
    (string->int "A") 
    (modulo (+ (- (string->int letter) (lock)) (string->int "A")) 26)))))
 
(define (decrypt-message-rand message)
  (implode (map (decode-char-function) (explode message))))

(random-seed key)
(decrypt-message-rand "KJLEY")

(random-seed key)
(encrypt-message-rand "AAAAA")
(random-seed key)
(decrypt-message-rand "DFATK")
               
(set! key 5) ; This redefines key to be 5
(random-seed key)

(encrypt-message-rand "HELLO")
(random-seed key)
(decrypt-message-rand "RHGJX")
