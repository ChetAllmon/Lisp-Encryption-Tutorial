        <h1>Simply Introduction to Cryptography in Racket</h1>
		<h2> The Caeser Cipher </h2>
		<p> The Caesar Cipher(CC) is a very old cipher. Although it is rather impractical for actual security, the Caesar Cipher(CC) is a very simple introduction to encryption and               decryption. 
            The basic use of the CC is to shift the letters of a message to the right in the alphabet. 
        </p>
        <p> 
		In practice:

		Message: "This is super secret" 

		When encrypted with a shift of one(1) becomes 

		Encrypted Message: "UIJT JT TVQFS TFDSFU"
        </p>
        <p>
		  With a shift of one(1) each letter is shifted to the right once, 
            A->B B->C C->D, ... Y->Z,Z->A,etc.
        </p>
            This method of encrypting a message makes it very easy to decrypt, simply shift back whatever number you used as the shift to encrypt the message
	    <p>
		  For a more in-depth explaination of the CC, as well as seeing an encrypter/decrypter program in action, you can visit http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/
        </p>
        <p>
		While you can use whatever shift you desire, even past 26(alphabet size, though this is the same as using a smaller number, I.E 27 shifts is the same as 2 shifts) The shift of 13 is the most common, this shift is known as ROT13. However, our code will be able to use whatever shift number(key) the user desires to input.
        </p>
        <p>
		The simplest method of encoding a letter is to add the key to the letter itself. (+ "A" 1) However, we cannot add letters to numbers, so we must convert "A" to a number(int)
        </p>
        <p>
        We can use (string->int "A") to do this, the result is 65.
        So, with a key of 1, A becomes (+ 65 1) = 66. If we use (int->string 66) we get "B". Now we can decode this letter, doing the opposite B to a number is 66, subtract the key, 65, 65 to a letter is "A".
        </p>
        <p>
        Now we can do this in code:
        </p>
        <code>
        (check-expect (encode-one-letter "A")   65)
        (check-expect (encode-one-letter "F")   70)
        (check-expect (encode-one-letter "Z")   90)

        (define (encode-one-letter letter) 
          (string->int letter))

        (check-expect (encrypt-one-letter "A" 1) "B")
        (check-expect (encrypt-one-letter "F" 1) "G")
        ;(check-expect (encrypt-one-letter "Z" 1) "A") ;Throws an error, "A" is expected, returned "["

        (define (encrypt-one-letter letter key)
          (int->string (+ (string->int letter) key)))
        </code>
        <p>
        The above code works, however, if we try to change "Z", it does not go to "A" like we want. This is because of the ascii table. Z is 90 on the acsii table, And [ is 91.
        So we have to account for the loop around of the alphabet. We can do this using modulo, which returns the remainder of 2 numbers. (modulo 5 3) = 2
        Note that (modulo (0-25) 26) will return the number given (0-25) (modulo 20 26) = 20, etc. However (modulo 26 26) = 0; Which brings us back to "A".
        </p>
        <code>
        (check-expect (encrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "A" 1) "B")
        (check-expect (encrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "F" 1) "G")
        (check-expect (encrypt-one-letter-with-modulo "Z" 1) "A") ;No error thrown!

        (define (encrypt-one-letter-with-modulo letter key)
            (int->string (+ (string->int "A") (modulo (- (+ (string->int letter) key) (string->int "A")) 26))))
        </code>
        <p>
        Note: we can simply replace (string->int "A") with 65, as we know the value, this saves the computer minimal processor power, but it mostly just clears up the code a bit.
        This is a matter of personal preference, if you prefer having the calculation to show where 65 came from feel free, you can also just add a comment to explain the 65.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ex:
        </p>
        <p>
        Origin of 65 in the following function: (string->int "A") = 65
        </p>
        <code>
        ;(define (encode-one-letter-with-modulo letter key)
        ;  (int->string (+ 65 (modulo (- (+ (string->int letter) key) 65) 26))))
        </code>
        <code>
        (check-expect (decode-one-letter "A")   65)
        (check-expect (decode-one-letter "F")   70)
        (check-expect (decode-one-letter "Z")   90)
        </code>
        <p>
        <strong> Note: </strong> this is the <strong> same </strong> as the encode function. 
        (define (decode-one-letter letter) 
          (string->int letter))
